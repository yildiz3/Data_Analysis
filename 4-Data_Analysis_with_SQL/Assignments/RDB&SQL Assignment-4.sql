-- ASSIGNMENT - 4

USE SampleRetail;

/*
Generate a report including product IDs and discount effects on 
whether the increase in the discount rate positively impacts 
the number of orders for the products.

In this assignment, you are expected to generate a solution using SQL 
with a logical approach.

Our group has discussed about the reference title for the solution (quantity or order_id). 
We have decided to use order_id because of the emphasis in the question.
