USE SampleRetail;

----1. By using view get the average sales by staffs and years using the AVG() aggregate function.
CREATE VIEW avg_sales
AS
SELECT		S.staff_id, YEAR(O.order_date) AS years, AVG((OI.list_price * OI.quantity)*(1-OI.discount)) AS avg_sale
FROM		sale.orders AS O
INNER JOIN	sale.staff AS S
ON			O.staff_id = S.staff_id
INNER JOIN	sale.order_item AS OI
ON			O.order_id = OI.order_id
GROUP BY	S.staff_id, YEAR(O.order_date)

SELECT	*
FROM	avg_sales

----2. Select the annual amount of product produced according to brands (use window functions).
SELECT		B.brand_name, P.model_year, -- P.product_id,
			COUNT(P.product_id) 
			OVER(PARTITION BY B.brand_name, P.model_year) AS annual_amount
FROM		product.brand B
INNER JOIN	product.product P
ON			B.brand_id = P.brand_id
ORDER BY	B.brand_name, P.model_year

----3. Select the least 3 products in stock according to stores.
SELECT	*
FROM	(
		SELECT		S.store_name, P.product_name, SUM(ST.quantity) quantity,
					ROW_NUMBER() 
					OVER(	PARTITION BY S.store_name 
							ORDER BY SUM(ST.quantity) ASC) AS least3
		FROM		sale.store S
		INNER JOIN	product.stock ST
		ON			S.store_id = ST.store_id
		INNER JOIN	product.product P
		ON			ST.product_id = P.product_id
		GROUP BY	S.store_name, P.product_name
		HAVING		SUM(ST.quantity) > 0
		) A
WHERE	A.least3 < 4

----4. Return the average number of sales orders in 2020 sales
SELECT	AVG(number_of_sales) avg_num_sales
FROM	(
		SELECT		S.order_id, COUNT(OI.order_id) AS number_of_sales
		FROM		sale.order_item OI
		INNER JOIN	sale.orders S
		ON			OI.order_id = S.order_id
		AND			YEAR(S.order_date) = 2020
		GROUP BY	S.order_id
		) AS sale_order

--

SELECT		OI.item_id, OI.product_id, S.order_id, COUNT(OI.order_id) AS number_of_sales
FROM		sale.order_item OI
INNER JOIN	sale.orders S
ON			OI.order_id = S.order_id
AND			YEAR(S.order_date) = 2020
GROUP BY	OI.item_id, OI.product_id, S.order_id

----5. Assign a rank to each product by list price in each brand 
--	and get products with rank less than or equal to three.

SELECT		*
FROM		(SELECT		*,
			RANK() 
			OVER (PARTITION BY brand_id ORDER BY list_price) AS rank1
			FROM		product.product
			) AS A
WHERE		rank1 <= 3
;

--

SELECT		*
FROM		(SELECT		*,
			DENSE_RANK() 
			OVER (PARTITION BY brand_id ORDER BY list_price) AS rank1
			FROM		product.product
			) AS A
WHERE		rank1 <= 3
